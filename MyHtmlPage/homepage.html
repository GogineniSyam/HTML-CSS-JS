    <h3>Description:</h3>
    <p>It’s the Bentley Bentayga, take two. 
      What you see here is a heavy facelift of the first gen SUV that launched in late 2015. 
      Over 1,000 new components. Most importantly, it’s better looking now. 
      While the overall shape is the same as before, the details have been fiddled with in some areas 
      and overhauled in others. 
      It’s much more appealing as a result, tauter of line and with more finesse in the detail. 
      The first Bentayga was ungainly at best, this one is… acceptable.
